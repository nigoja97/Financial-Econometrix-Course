#
# ### Exercise 35
# For the same portfolios in the previous exercise, compute rolling $\beta$s
# using 60 consecutive observations.

# ### Exercise 36
#
# For each of the four $\beta$s, produce a plot containing four series:
#
# * A line corresponding to the constant $\beta$ (full sample)
# * The $\beta$ estimated on the rolling sample
# * The constant $\beta$ plus $1.96 \times$ the variance of a 60-observation estimate of $\beta$.
#   The 60-month covariance can be estimated using a full sample VCV and rescaling it by T/60
#   where T is the length of the full sample used to estimate the VCV. Alternatively, the VCV
#   could be estimated by first estimating the 60-month VCV for each sub-sample and then averaging
#   these.
# * The constant $\beta$ minus $1.96 \times$ the variance of a 60-observation estimate of $\beta$.
