# ## Linear Regression: Model Estimation
#
# **Functions**
#
# `sm.OLS`
#
# ### Exercise 32
# Use the OLS function to estimate the coefficients of the Fama-French portfolios (monthly data) on the
# market, size and value factors. Include a constant in the regressions. Use only the four
# extremum portfolios â€“ that is the 1-1, 1-5, 5-1 and 5-5 portfolios. Estimate the model with
# homoskedastic errors and with White's covariance estimator.

#%%


#%%
# ### Exercise 33
# Are the parameter standard errors similar using the two covariance estimators?
# If not, what does this mean?

#%%


#%%
# ### Exercise 34
# How much of the variation is explained by these three regressors?
