#%%
# ### Exercise 25
# Simulate a set of i.i.d. $\chi_{5}^{2}$ random variables and use the method of moments
# to estimate the mean and variance.

#%%


#%%
# ### Exercise 26
# Compute the asymptotic variance of the method of moment estimator.

#%%


#%%
# ### Exercise 27
# Repeat Exercises 24 and 25 a total of 1000 times.
# Examine the finite sample bias of these estimators relative to the true values.

#%%


#%%
# ### Exercise 28
# Repeat Exercises 24 and 25 a total of 1000 times.
# Compare the covariance of the estimated means and variance (1000 of each) to the asymptotic covariance of the parameters (use the average of the 1000 estimated variance-covariances). Are these close? How does the sample size affect this?

#%%


#%%
# ### Exercise 29
# In the previous problem, for each parameter, form a standardized parameter estimate as
#
# $$z_{i}=\frac{\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}_{i}-\theta_{i,0}\right)}{\sqrt{\hat{\Sigma}_{ii}}}$$
#
# where
#
# $$\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta_{0}\right)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow} N\left(0,\Sigma\right)$$
#
# so that $\hat{\Sigma}$ is the estimated asymptotic covariance. What percent of these $z_{i}$
# are larger in absolute value than 10%, 5% and 1% 2-sided critical values from a normal?

#%%


#%%
# ### Exercise 30
# Produce a density plot of the $z_{i}$ standardized parameters and compare to a standard normal.

#%%


#%%
# ### Exercise 31
# Repeat the same exercise for the Bernoulli problem from the previous question.
