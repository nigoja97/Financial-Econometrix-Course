# # Constructing DataFrames from Series
#
# This lesson introduced method to construct a DataFrame from multiple
# Series.
#
# This first block loads the variables created in an earlier lesson.  A
# later lesson will cover loading and saving data.

# ## Problem: Construct a DataFrame from rows
#
# Create a DataFrame named `prices_row` from the row vectors previously
# entered such that the results are identical to prices. For example, the first
# two days worth of data are:
#
# ```python
# dates_2 = pd.to_datetime(["1998-09-04", "1998-09-05"])
# prices_row = pd.DataFrame([sep_04, sep_05])
# # Set the index after using concat to join
# prices_row.index = dates_2
# ```
#
# Verify that the DataFrame identical by printing the difference with
# `prices`
#
# ```python
# print(prices_row - prices)
# ```

#%%


#%%
# ## Problem: Construct a DataFrame from columns
#
# Create a DataFrame named `prices_col` from the 3 column vectors entered
# such that the results are identical to prices.
#
# *Note*: `.T` transposes a 2-d array since `DataFrame` builds the
# array by rows.
#
# Verify that the DataFrame identical by printing the difference with
# `prices`

#%%


#%%
# ## Problem: Construct a DataFrame from a dictionary
#
# Create a DataFrame named `prices_dict` from the 3 column vectors entered
# such that the results are identical to prices
#
# Verify that the DataFrame identical by printing the difference with
# `prices`

# ## Exercises
#
# ### Exercise: Create a DataFrame from rows
#
# Use the three series populated below to create a DataFrame using each
# as a row.
#
# **Note**: Notice what happens in the resulting `DataFrame` since one of the
# `Series` has 4 elements while the others have 3.

#%%
# Setup: Data for the Exercises
import pandas as pd

index = ["Num", "Let", "Date"]
a = pd.Series([1, "A", pd.Timestamp(2018, 12, 31)], name="a", index=index)
b = pd.Series([2, "B", pd.Timestamp(2018, 12, 31)], name="b", index=index)
index = ["Num", "Let", "Date", "Float"]
c = pd.Series([3, "C", pd.Timestamp(2018, 12, 31), 3.0], name="c", index=index)

# ### Exercise: Build a DataFrame from Columns
#
# Build a `DataFrame` from the three series where each is used as a column.
