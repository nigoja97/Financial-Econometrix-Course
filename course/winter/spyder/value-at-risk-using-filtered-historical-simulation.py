# ## Value-at-Risk: Using Filtered Historical Simulation
#
# **Functions**
#
# `arch_model`, `ARCHModelResult.std_resid`, `np.percentile`
#
# ### Exercise 82
# Use a GARCH(1,1) model to construct filtered historical VaR for the S&P 500 and
# the EUR/USD exchange rate, using 10 years of data.
#
# **Note**: For simplicity, estimate the model on the full sample, but start the
# historical simulation at 25% of the data, and then build the additional forecasts
# using a recursive scheme.
